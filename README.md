# Task 6: Contact Form with JavaScript Validation

A responsive contact form built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, featuring real-time client-side validation. This project demonstrates how to validate user inputs and provide instant feedback — ensuring clean, usable data before submission.

# Objective

Create a functional contact form that:
- Validates **Name**, **Email**, and **Message** fields
- Provides clear feedback for invalid inputs
- Prevents form submission until all fields are valid

No backend integration — all validation is handled in the browser.

# Tools & Technologies

- **HTML5** – Form structure
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Input validation logic
- **VS Code** – Development environment
- **Chrome Browser** – Testing and debugging
